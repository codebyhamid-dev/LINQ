**LINQ Queries in C#**

This repository showcases the use of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) in C# to manipulate and analyze a collection of games. It demonstrates a wide range of operations, including filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregation, pagination, and joining datasets.

**Overview**

The project works with a list of games, where each game has the following properties: title, genre, release year, rating, and price. Through this collection, the repository illustrates how to perform common data operations in C# using LINQ in a clear and practical way.

**LINQ Operations Demonstrated**

**Selecting Data** – Extract specific properties from the collection, such as retrieving all game titles.

**Filtering** – Identify games that meet certain criteria, such as specific genres, ratings above a threshold, or price ranges.

**Ordering and Sorting** – Arrange games by release year, rating, or other properties, in both ascending and descending order.

**Aggregation and Counting** – Perform calculations such as counting the total number of games, summing prices, or finding the highest and lowest ratings.

**Grouping** – Organize games into groups based on shared characteristics, such as genre.

**Pagination** – Retrieve subsets of the collection using skip and take operations, simulating paging in larger datasets.

**First, Single, and Last Queries** – Retrieve the first, last, or a single game matching a condition, with safe handling when no matches exist.

**Distinct and Existence Checks** – Identify unique values, check for the presence of specific games, or verify conditions across all items in the collection.

**Joins** – Combine the games collection with other related datasets, such as game reviews, to enrich the information available.

**Purpose
**
This project serves as a comprehensive reference for developers learning LINQ in C#. It demonstrates how to efficiently query and manipulate collections, providing practical examples of common operations used in real-world applications.
